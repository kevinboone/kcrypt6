<h1>KCrypt -- frequently asked questions</h1>

Version 6.0, March 2013

<p/>
<h3>How secure is KCrypt?</h3>
KCrypt is designed to be cryptographically `unbreakable', that is, to 
use the best cryptographic techniques available 
outside of the military. It is extremely unlikely that standard
cryptanalysis 
techniques could be used to decrypt your files without the appropriate key. 
Of course, 
it is not 
<i>impossible</i>
that this will happen in the future, especially as computers become more 
powerful.  However, 
this is true of any encryption scheme, and there are currently some very weak 
ones available commercially. 
For example, I understand that it is now possible to buy
a program that cracks the encryption schemes used by Microsoft Office 
in a fraction of a 
second. KCrypt has to be an improvement on this, and it is. 
KCrypt uses by default
the IDEA algorithm, which has so far withstood all known attempts to crack it.
IDEA is one of the class of encryption techniques that
are <i>algorithmically secure</i>. This means that the security is provided 
by the
process itself, not by secrecy about how it is implemented. The IDEA alogorithm
is well-publicized and has been the subject of much research.  
Because this algorithm is used by PGP, it has received a lot of attention from
cryptanalysts, and if there were any obvious weaknesses they would no doubt
have come to light by now. KCrypt uses IDEA in cipher feedback mode, which
reduces the tendency of repeated patterns of data in the plaintext file
to produce repeated patterns in the ciphertext. So far as the operating
system allows, KCrypt tries to avoid leaving passwords in memory where
they could be sniffed out by a very determined hacker, and to wipe
clean any temporary files before they are deleted.
<p/>
The major weakness of KCrypt, as it is of other programs of this sort, 
is inappropriate use. 
For example, you may use it to encrypt a file produced using your word 
processor, but forget 
to encrypt the backup copy it made. These issues are discussed in great
detail in the main page. 

<h3>How do I know I can trust this program at all?</h3>

I maintain KCrypt because I need it for myself, I like to be helpful, and 
I can't legally sell it because of patent complications surrounding the
IDEA algorithm (although these have now lapsed). 
I trust it because I wrote it, but why should you? How do you know that 
it doesn't leave back doors 
by which I can decipher your secret files? How do you know it doesn't 
transmit your secret files to me 
over the Internet? The simple answer, of course, is that you don't, if
you are using a pre-compiled version of the program. This problem applies to
<i>any</i>
encryption product you buy or obtain free-of-charge, not just this one. If you
want to be really sure you know what KCrypt is doing, you should get the source
code and compile it yourself. You should be able to find the source code in the
same place as you found the executable program, if you haven't already. You can
then check the implementation of the IDEA algorithm in KCrypt against the
sample code provided by the original designers.  

<h3>What platforms does KCrypt run on?</h3>

It is known to work on Windows 7, Fedora Linux, and
Android (in a terminal emulator). It can probably be built on
most platforms for which a C compiler is available. At present,
a graphical user interface is only available for Windows.


<h3>Can KCrypt be use for email encryption?</h3>

It is probably not appropriate. KCrypt is symmetric -- that is, 
it uses the same key for encryption and decryption. Both the sender and
the recipient would need the same key.

<h3>Why is there not an automated installer?</h3>

Becuase I lack the time to maintain installers for all the platforms
that KCrypt runs on. Installation is trivial -- copy the program
to any directory on the command line search path. Integrating the
Windows GUI version with explorer is a two-minute point-and-click
operation. Of course, anybody who wants to build an installer for
some system or other is very welcome to.

<h3>Can I have files in the same directory encrypted with different keys?</h3>

Yes, but KCrypt is much easier to use if you use the same key for
groups of files. If asked to process a file for which the current key is
incorrect, KCrypt will simply skip the file.

<h3>Why is the file size reported by <code>kcrypt --list</code> different
from the size on disk?</h3>

KCrypt adds a header to the encrypted file to identify that it is
encrypted, and what algorithm was used, among other things. It 
also pads out the size of the file to a fixed number of encyption blocks.
This padding is removed on decryption as, of course, is the header.
These overheads about about 300 bytes to the encyrypted file.

<h3>Why do I need to enter a key just to get information about the file?</h3>

Because this information is itself encrypted in the file. Lacking the
key, there is no
information about an encrypted file that could not be easily obtained using
the `ls' command, or whatever. KCrypt's `list' function provides information
about encrypted files only. Specifically, it reports the original filename of a
file whose name has been mangled. This information must be encrypted, otherwise
there is no purpose in name mangling. 

<h3>Why does KCrypt ask for a key, even when I have accidentally 
specified a non-existent file and there is no way it could be processed?</h3>

KCrypt will ask for a key before starting any encrypt or decrypt operation. 
It will do this even if the specified files do not exist, or are
impossible to read. The reason for this is that KCrypt is designed to operate
on many files at a time, and a particular operation may fail on one file and
succeed on the next. Thus the key has to be established first. It would be
possible to update the logic such that it behaves differently if only one file
is specified, but this is a serious nuisance, and makes operation inconsistent.

<h3>What is filename mangling?</h3>

To further protect files from attack, KCrypt can conceal the original names
of files. If your files are clearly named, then an unauthorised intruder knows
at least which files to attack. If they are not usefully named, then 
he or she has to attempt
to decrypt a heap of files to be sure to get the interesting one. 
KCrypt does not even leave a clear mark of its own existence in the
mangled files. It is not trivially easy to determine even that the
file is encrypted. Of course, a person who was prepared to study the
source code of KCrypt could work out what its encrypted files looked like
internally.

<h3>Can KCrypt read decrypt files encrypted by PGP, or vice versa?</h3> 
At present, no, even though both use the same cipher algorithm. 
When I set out to write KCrypt I did not have access
to information about PGP's file formats, and even now I'm not sure that the way
PGP saves data is optimal for personal (as opposed to communications) security.

<h3>KCrypt is slow. How can it be made faster?</h3>

The encryption is mathematically intensive, and even with as much
optimization as I can muster it is not blazingly fast. Encrypting files
that are gigabytes in size takes minutes, even on a powerful computer.
<p/>
If speed is a real concern, you can use KCrypt with the <code>--xor</code>
switch, which makes it use a much faster, but not very strong, 
XOR-based cipher (similar to the technique used by WinZIP, for example).

<h3>Does KCrypt support files larger than 2Gb?</h3>

It should do, although you'll have time for a cup of tea while they
are being processed. Please let me know if you experience problems
with large files. 

<h3>Can KCrypt be used to protect files shared using, for example, DropBox?</h3>

In principle, yes. It works, and can be quite effective. However, KCrypt
always encrypts and decrypts files into the same directory. This means
that if you decrypt a file in a DropBox directory, edit it, and encrypt
it again, DropBox will detect the change in the file that resulted from
the decryption, and transmit the decrypted version over the network. 
Shortly thereafter it will transmit the re-encrypted version, but the
concern is that a plaintext version has been held on the server, at 
least transiently.
<p/>
Similarly, DropBox might detect the creation of temporary files in
the same directory, and transmit those over the network. If you need a
system where a plaintext file is <i>never</i> passed to the network 
server, even temporarily, KCrypt is not what you need.  
<p/>
You could, of course, encrypt the file in a directory outside of
DropBox, then copy the encrypted version to the DropBox folder. 
The same approach could be applied to decryption. Nevertheless, there
are probably better solutions to problem of securing files on
shared cloud storage.
