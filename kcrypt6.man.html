<h3/>DISCLAIMER</h3/>

An encryption program, by definition, turns useful files into incomprehensible
garbage. Please test this program very
carefully on non-critical data before trusting it on important files. The
author accepts
no responsibility whatever for undesired consequences of using this software.

<h3/>DESCRIPTION</h3/>

KCrypt 
is a straightforward file encrypter/obfuscator, intended to provide 
strong security for sensitive files. It encrypts files using a key (password),
making them incomprehensible until they are decrypted, using the same key.
By default KCrypt uses the IDEA algorith, but can be set to user a 
faster (and weaker) method if preferred.

<h3/>OVERVIEW OF OPERATION</h3/>

In its most straightforward usage, KCrypt is invoked in either `encrypt' or
`decrypt' mode, using the `-e' switch for encryption,
<BR>&nbsp;or&nbsp;the&nbsp;`-d'&nbsp;switch&nbsp;for&nbsp;decryption,&nbsp;followed&nbsp;by&nbsp;a&nbsp;list&nbsp;of&nbsp;files&nbsp;to
encrypt or decrypt. For example, executing
<P>

kcrypt -e *
<P>

encrypts all the files in the current directory that are not already encrypted,
while 
<P>

kcrypt -d fred
<P>

decrypts the file `fred'. In both cases, no extra files are created; the new
file replaces the old one.
<P>

In all operations, KCrypt displays a status report, including the designation
`OK', `SKIPPED' or `ERROR'.
`SKIPPED' means that the operation requested was not appropriate to a
particular file. For example, KCrypt will not encrypt a file that is already
encrypted; this is not considered an error but a skip. However, attempting to
encrypt or decrypt a non-regular file (e.g., a device or directory name) would
be considered an error and marked as such.

<h3/>OPTIONS</h3/>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT><DT><B>-c,--cat&nbsp;{</B><I>paths</I><B>}</B>

<DD>
<DD>
Decrypt the specified files to standard output. This form of decryption
does not produce any temporary files.
</DL>
<P>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>-d,--decrypt&nbsp;{</B><I>paths</I><B>}</B>

<DD>
Decrypt the specified files or folders. 
</DL>
<P>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>-e,--encrypt&nbsp;{</B><I>paths</I><B>}</B>

<DD>
Encrypt the specified files in place, that is, retaining the original
names. See also <B>--encryptmangle</B>. 
</DL>
<P>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>-f,--max-files&nbsp;{</B><I>number</I><B>}</B>

<DD>
Sets the number of files that KCrypt is prepared to process in one
operation, in recursive mode. The default is twenty. 
There is no limit to the number of files that KCrypt will process if
they are specified explicitly on the command-line, even with wildcards.
</DL>
<P>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>-l,--list&nbsp;{</B><I>paths</I><B>}</B>

<DD>
Display information about encrypted files, including the original sizes and the
time and date of encryption. One of the most important uses of <B>--list</B> 
is to
determine the original filename for files that have had their names mangled
(see below). Note that you will need to enter the password to see this 
information,
as it is all stored in the file in encrypted format.
</DL>
<P>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>-m,--encryptmangle&nbsp;{</B><I>paths</I><B>}</B>

<DD>
Encrypt and mangle the names of the specified files. The file will be 
renamed to a random number, with the original name stored internally
in encrypted format. 
</DL>
<P>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>-n,--no-colour</B>

<DD>
Do not highlight status reports in colour, even if the terminal 
supports it.
</DL>
<P>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>-p,--password&nbsp;{</B><I>password</I><B>}</B>

<DD>
Use the specified password, rather than prompting. Very insecure -- should
only ever be used for testing.
</DL>
<P>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>-r,--recurse</B>

<DD>
Recurse into subdirectories. Because of the possibility of disaster,
only the first 20 files found will be processed. This behaviour can
be overridden using the <B>--max-files</B> switch
</DL>
<P>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>--version</B>

<DD>
Display the version number. 
</DL>
<P>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>-v,--verbose</B>

<DD>
Output debugging information.
</DL>
<P>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>-w,--wipe&nbsp;{</B><I>paths</I><B>}</B>

<DD>
Wiping a file is a strong form of deletion. The file is overwritten with
zeros and then deleted. 
</DL>
<P>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>-x,--xor</B>

<DD>
Use the fast, weak XOR-based cipher, rather than the much stronger
IDEA method.
</DL>
<P>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>-y,--yes</B>

<DD>
Answer 'yes' to all confirmation prompts.
</DL>

KCrypt is based on information from a number of sources. 
The IDEA algorithm iteself was developed by Dr Xuejia Lai and 
Prof. James L Massey.

Block Ciphers'', ETH Series on Information Processing (ed. Massey, JL)

<h3/>BUGS</h3/>

Occasional instances of odd behaviour have been reported when encrypting and
decrypting files with `odd' access rights (e.g., write-only).
